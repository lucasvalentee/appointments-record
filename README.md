# Appointments record

The project consists of an API made with Node.js and Typescript to perform tests with programming principles in the backend. It is possible to register new appointments and validate them.

## How to start

1 - After cloning the repository to your machine, access the repository folder through a terminal and run the <b>yarn</b> command to install the dependencies.</br>
2 - With the dependencies installed, run the command <b>yarn dev:server</b> to start the server.</br>
3 - You will need a tool to make requests for the Rest API such as <b>Insomnia</b> or <b>Postman</b>.</br>
4 - The base URL is <b>http://localhost:3333</b>.</br>

## How to use the API

- There are two routes, one POST and one GET, both in the path <b>http://localhost:3333/appointments</b>.
